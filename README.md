# rainfall-predictor
In this project, the main objective is to predict rainfall (precipitation) levels using various weather parameters from the Austin Weather dataset. We began by importing necessary Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn to handle data manipulation, visualization, and modeling. The dataset was first loaded into a DataFrame using Pandas, followed by an exploratory phase where we examined the structure of the data, including column names, missing values, and unique symbols like `'T'` (trace amounts) and `'-'` that needed to be cleaned or converted into meaningful numerical values (like `0.0`).

Next, we focused on data cleaning. Unnecessary columns such as dates or irrelevant identifiers were removed to keep only the predictive features. All columns containing non-numeric entries were converted to floats, and rows with missing or incorrect values were handled accordingly. This preprocessing step ensured that the dataset was ready for building a machine learning model.

We then used Linear Regression from the `sklearn.linear_model` library to train a model that predicts the `PrecipitationSumInches` column using other features like average temperature, humidity, dew point, wind speed, and visibility. The dataset was split into training and testing sets to validate the model’s performance. We evaluated the model using standard regression metrics like R² score and mean squared error to assess how well it captured the underlying trends.

Finally, we created visualizations to better understand the relationships in the data. Line plots showed how precipitation changed over time, while scatter plots illustrated correlations between precipitation and weather features such as humidity and temperature. These visual insights added depth to our analysis and helped interpret the model's predictions. The project wrapped up with well-commented code and clean visuals that summarize the entire prediction process, showcasing both technical skills and data storytelling.
